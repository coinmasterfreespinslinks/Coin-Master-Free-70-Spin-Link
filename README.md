Spins are the currency of Coin Master. You need them to perform key actions in the game, including:

- **Spinning the Slot Machine**: This is the heart of the game. Each spin gives you the chance to earn coins, attack other players’ villages, raid villages for loot, or get shields and hammers.

- **Attacking and Raiding**: Spins are required to attack or raid other players’ villages. These actions allow you to steal coins, destroy villages, and take valuable loot. With free spins, you can attack and raid without worrying about running out of spins quickly.

- **Building Your Village**: As you collect coins from spins, you can use them to build and upgrade your village. The more you upgrade, the better rewards you unlock. Free spins can accelerate this process and help you reach new levels.

- **Opening Chests**: Chests contain valuable rewards like pets, cards, and other bonuses. You need spins to open these chests, which are key to progressing through the game.

In short, **spins** are everything in Coin Master. They help you level up, earn rewards, and stay competitive. The more spins you have, the more chances you get to grow your village and unlock exciting prizes.
